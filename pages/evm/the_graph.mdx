# The Graph

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is an indexing protocol that provides an easy way to query blockchain data through decentralized APIs known as subgraphs. 

With The Graph, developers can benefit from:
 - Decentralized Indexing: Enables indexing blockchain data through multiple indexers, thus eliminating any single point of failure
 - GraphQL Queries: Provides a powerful GraphQL interface for querying indexed data, making data retrieval super simple.
 - Customization: Define your own logic for transforming & storing blockchain data. Reuse subgraphs published by other developers on The Graph Network.

Follow this quick-start guide to create, deploy, and query a subgraph within 5 minutes.

### Benefits

Indexers like The Graph create a queryable data layer specifically tracking events and state changes from your smart contract. By monitoring and organizing this contract data, they enable complex queries that would be impossible through direct blockchain calls. This allows your dApp to efficiently access historical transactions, track relationships between entities, and analyze patterns over time - all without multiple RPC calls.

### Prerequisites

- A crypto wallet
- A smart contract address on a supported network
- Node.js⁠ installed
- A package manager of your choice (npm, yarn or pnpm)

### Quick Start guide

1. Proceed to the [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio) and login via one of the supported wallets.

2. Confirm the sign and sign a message to use Studio.

3. Click on **Create a Subgraph** on the main dashboard.

4. Specify the **Subgraph Name**.

5. Upon creating a Subgraph, you will see its dashboard, where you can a project description, source code URL, and a website URL.

6. On the right side, click on **Select a network** and pick **Autonomys** from the dropdown list.

7. Install **Graph CLI** using provided commands. You can use `yarn`, `npm`, `pnpm`, or `bun`. 

8. Initialize the subgraph by running `graph init autonomys-subgraph`. This will create a boilerplate subgraph code. 
During the initialization, you will need to specify a few things:
- Network (Autonomys)
- Subgraph slug (feel free to use the default name)
- Directory to create the subgraph in (feel free to use the default directory)
- Smart contact address (the address of your smart contract deployed on Autonomys Taurus EVM domain)
- ABI file(path)
- Start block (feel free to use the default value)
- Contract name
- Index contacts events as entities (true or false value)

> Tip: you can find the contract ABI by looking at the `token_metadata` file. 
E.g. if you're using Remix IDE, find your contract metadata file, collaps it on the `abi` line 7, copy the entire `abi` including the square brakets **[]** and save it into a `json` file on your PR.

9. Run `graph auth` to authenticate the project and provide your deploy key which you can find on the **Subgraph Dashboard**.

10. Cd into the directory by doing `cd project_name` and run `graph codegen && graph build` to build the project, you will see the `build/subgraph.yaml` file being created.

11. Deploy your subgraph by running `graph deploy subgraph-autonomys`. You will be asked to specify the version of the subgraph, e.g. v0.0.1. 

    ![the-graph-12](/developers/the-graph-12.png)

12. Proceed back to the **Graph Studio**, the status would change to **Deployed**. 

    ![the-graph-13](/developers/the-graph-13.png)

13. The new tabs **Playground**, **Endpoints**, **Logs** would now be accessible to you! You would find usage examples of quering the data, accessing the data via API, and can test queries in the **Playground** without leaving the studio!

Congratulations, you've successfully setup and configured subgraph for your application!
