# Account Balances and Transaction Fees on Auto EVM

## Introduction

While Auto EVM strives to maintain EVM compatibility, there are some important differences that developers should understand regarding account balances and transaction fees. These differences stem from Auto EVM's Substrate-based architecture and affect how balances are managed and fees are calculated.

## Key Concepts

### Existential Deposit (ED)

The Existential Deposit is a minimum balance that must be maintained in any account or contract to keep it alive on the network.

- Current ED value: 0.000001 TAI3
- Applies to both user accounts and smart contracts
- Cannot be withdrawn or transferred out
- Prevents dust accounts and maintains network efficiency

### Consensus Storage Fees

In addition to standard gas fees, Auto EVM implements consensus storage fees:

- Applied to transactions that modify state
- Separate from execution fees
- Deducted from the sender's account
- Scale with the size of state changes
- Not currently visible in BlockScout UI

## Impact on Smart Contracts

### Balance Management

When working with smart contracts on Auto EVM, be aware that:

1. Contracts cannot be fully emptied due to ED requirements
2. The minimum balance (ED) will always remain in the contract
3. The maximum withdrawable amount from a contract is: `total_balance - ED`

### Example Scenarios

**Deposit and Withdrawal:**
```
Initial deposit: 0.01 TAI3
Available for withdrawal: 0.009999 TAI3 (due to ED)
Contract state balance: 0.01 TAI3
```

**Fee Deduction:**
- Transaction fees (execution + storage) are deducted from the sender's account
- The contract's internal accounting may show different values than the actual on-chain balance

## Best Practices

### Smart Contract Development

1. Account for ED in withdrawal functions:
   - Always leave the ED amount in the contract
   - Check for sufficient balance above ED before transfers

2. Fee Handling:
   - Consider both execution and storage fees in transaction planning
   - Add buffer for storage fees in critical operations

### Testing Considerations

1. Test withdrawal edge cases:
   - Attempt to withdraw full balance
   - Verify behavior with amounts close to ED
   - Check contract state after failed withdrawals

2. Balance Verification:
   - Use RPC calls to verify actual available balance
   - Compare contract state with on-chain state
   - Account for ED in balance calculations

## Differences from Ethereum

1. Balance Management:
   - Ethereum: No minimum balance requirement
   - Auto EVM: Requires ED maintenance

2. Fee Structure:
   - Ethereum: Gas fees only
   - Auto EVM: Gas fees + consensus storage fees

3. Contract Behavior:
   - Ethereum: Contracts can be fully emptied
   - Auto EVM: ED must remain in contracts

## Tools and Verification

### Checking Balances

To verify actual available balances:
- Use Polkadot.js interface
- Query contract state directly
- Account for ED and storage fees in calculations

### Transaction Planning

When planning transactions:
1. Calculate required fees (execution + storage)
2. Ensure sufficient balance above ED
3. Add buffer for potential storage fee variations

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. "Insufficient Balance" errors:
   - Check if attempting to withdraw below ED
   - Verify sufficient balance for fees
   - Consider storage fees in calculations

2. Balance Discrepancies:
   - Compare BlockScout UI with actual RPC calls
   - Account for storage fees in calculations
   - Remember ED requirements
