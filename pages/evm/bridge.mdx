Bridges are critical infrastructure components for robust blockchain networks, enabling users to seamlessly access liquidity and applications across different blockchain ecosystems. With these Hyperlane bridges, Autonomys users can effortlessly transfer assets between networks, unlocking a broader range of possibilities and interactions.

## Available Bridges

### Mainnet Bridge

The mainnet bridge connects Autonomys mainnet with:
- Ethereum mainnet
- Binance Smart Chain mainnet

### Chronos Testnet Bridge  

**URL:** https://bridge.chronos.autonomys.xyz/

The testnet bridge connects the Chronos Auto EVM domain with:
- Ethereum's Sepolia testnet
- Binance Smart Chain testnet

This testnet environment is perfect for developers and users to experiment with cross-chain functionality without risking mainnet assets.
