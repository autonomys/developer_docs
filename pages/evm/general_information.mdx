## Developer Tools

Developing smart contracts and decentralized applications involves a suite of tools that aid in writing, testing and deploying code on the blockchain. As Autonomys utilizes an instance of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), **every tool used to build, test and deploy smart contracts on Ethereum is fully compatible with the Auto EVM**.

### Writing smart contracts

Solidity is the primary programming language for writing smart contracts. It is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types, making it familiar for developers with a background in other statically typed languages such as C++, Java, or JavaScript. Solidity has a great community of developers and extensive documentation is available on the official [website](https://soliditylang.org/).

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are often used to aid in writing smart contracts. We recommend the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/), a browser-based IDE that enables you to write, deploy and interact with Solidity smart contracts. It features a built-in static analysis tool that checks your code for common errors.

### Development and testing

For local development and testing, spin up your own version of an Autonomys Developer Node and farmer, or alternatively, use EVM-compatible development tools like [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/overview) or [Anvil](https://book.getfoundry.sh/anvil/) to deploy contracts, develop applications and run tests.

### Deploying and interacting with smart contracts

A JavaScript provider like the one injected by the [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension is used to deploy and interact with smart contracts. This provider enables JavaScript applications to communicate with the Autonomys Network and any other Ethereum-compatible network. It's compatible with both [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) and [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.10.0/)/[Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), allowing developers to use either library for their blockchain operations.

All these tools together provide an cohesive ecosystem for EVM-compatible smart contract development, making the process significantly more manageable and efficient.
