## Sending NFTs

> *Note:* NFT minting and transfers are currently available exclusively on the **Taurus** testnet using the Autonomys NFT contract deployed at `0x505c243ec05dF81bC33295fF7C135D4D98063Da5`.

This guide walks you through sending NFTs on Autonomys using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), a [Metamask-connected wallet](https://metamask.io/), and the [Eternal Mint](https://eternalmint.xyz/) platform.

### NFTs on Autonomys Network

Autonomys NFTs offer a significant advantage over traditional NFT infrastructure.

> **Unlike platforms that rely on IPFS**, Autonomys stores NFT's metadata and digital assets directly on **[Auto Drive](https://ai3.storage/)**, our permanent decentralized storage.

- 🔒 Both your NFT **metadata and digital asset** (e.g., image, music file) are **never at risk of disappearing** due to expired IPFS pins.
- 🌐 Each NFT is linked to a **permanent Auto Drive record** that ensures long-term storage.
- 🚫 No third-party dependency — your NFT will never go offline.

### Quick Start Guide

This guide assumes you have experience with MetaMask and Remix.

### Step 1: Mint Your NFT

1. Visit [Eternal Mint](https://eternalmint.xyz/).

2. Connect the wallet of your choice.

3. Mint your NFT by filling in the following fields:
- **Name**: The title of your NFT.
- **Supply**: The number of editions you'd like to mint.
- **External Link**: (Optional) A link to an external website or resource.
- **Description**: A brief explanation or story behind your NFT.
- **Upload Image**: The visual or media file representing your NFT (e.g., image, GIF, video).

4. Once minted, **copy your NFT’s Token ID** — you’ll need it to send the NFT.

### Step 2: Load the Contract in Remix

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Create a new Solidity file (e.g. `NFTTransfer.sol`), or use the deployed contract. The contract Address: `0x505c243ec05dF81bC33295fF7C135D4D98063Da5`.

3. Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler tab.

### Step 3: Connect Remix to MetaMask

1. In Remix, navigate to the **Deploy & Run Transactions** panel.
2. Set the Environment to **Injected Provider - MetaMask**.
3. Connect your MetaMask wallet that’s configured to the **Taurus** testnet. 
For more detailed instructions, check out our [guide on connecting Remix to the Taurus testnet](/evm//remix).

### Step 4: Deploy or Load the NFT Contract

- If deploying a new contract: Click **Deploy** and confirm in MetaMask.
- If using the existing NFT contract: Paste the deployed contract address into the `At Address` field and click **At Address**.

### Step 5: Use `safeTransferFrom` to Send Your NFT

Scroll down to the **Deployed Contracts** section and find the `safeTransferFrom` function. Fill in the following fields:

- `from`: Your wallet address (the current NFT holder)
- `to`: The recipient’s wallet address
- `id`: Token ID of the NFT you want to send
- `value`: Number of NFTs to send (usually `1`)
- `data`: Optional; use `0x` if not needed

Click **transact** and confirm the transaction in MetaMask.

### Verification

After the minting, the NFT will appear in the recipient’s wallet. You can verify the transfer using the [Block explorer for the Autonomys testnet](https://explorer.auto-evm.chronos.autonomys.xyz//)

**Here's how**:

1. Open the transaction on Blockscout.
2. Click on **"Token Transfers"** to view the minted token details.

**OR**

1. Go to the **"Tokens"** tab.
2. Select **"NFTs"** to see your newly minted NFT listed there!

### Troubleshooting

- **Gas issues?** Try increasing the gas limit manually in Remix.
- **Transaction fails?** Double-check your Token ID and that you’re connected to the correct network.
- **Contract not found?** Ensure you’ve loaded the contract at the correct address (`0x505c243ec05dF81bC33295fF7C135D4D98063Da5`).
