## Adding the Autonomys RPC to MetaMask

This guide will help you set up a [**MetaMask**](https://metamask.io/) wallet (any EVM-compatible wallet works) and connect it to the Autonomys EVM development network.

1. Download the MetaMask extension for your browser from the [MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/) after selecting your preferred language (in the top-right corner), and reading and agreeing to MetaMask's Terms of Use.

3. Set a secure password that’s difficult to guess. Type it twice before proceeding to the next step. MetaMask automatically assesses the strength of your password.
> *Note:* Your password should include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.

9. Input the values below to connect to the Autonomys RPC: 

  ```
  Network Name: Autonomys EVM
  New RPC URL: https://auto-evm-0.taurus.subspace.network/ws
  Chain ID: 490000
  Currency Symbol: tAI3
  ```

You have now successfully set up a MetaMask wallet and connected it to the Auto EVM! To deploy a smart contract, you first need to get a small amount of **tAI3** tokens in your wallet. Refer to the [faucet section](http://develop.autonomys.xyz/evm/faucet) of the guide to learn more about getting testnet tokens.
