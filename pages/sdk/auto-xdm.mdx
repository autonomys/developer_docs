## Auto XDM

> *Note:* Cross-domain messaging (XDM) is not yet enabled on the Taurus testnet or Autonomys Network mainnet.

### Available functions

#### Cross-domain transfers

> *Note:* The `transfer` function returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `SubmittableExtrinsic`, which can be signed and submitted to the blockchain.

- `transfer(api: ApiPromise, destination: ChainOrDomain, receiver: string, amount: Amount): Promise<SubmittableExtrinsic>`: Creates a transaction to transfer a specified amount to a receiver at a given destination (can be either on the consensus chain or a specific domain).

#### Types

- **Amount**: `BigInt | number | string`  
  Represents the amount to be transferred.

- **ChainOrDomain**: `Consensus | Domain`  
  A union type representing either the consensus chain or a domain.

- **Consensus**: `{ type: 'consensus' }`  
  Specifies the consensus chain as the destination.

- **Domain**: `{ type: 'domain'; domainId: number }`  
  Specifies a domain as the destination, identified by a `domainId`.

## Usage example

```typescript
// For transferring to the consensus chain
await transfer(api, { type: 'consensus' }, 'receiverAddress', amount)

// For transferring to a specific domain
await transfer(api, { type: 'domain', domainId: 1 }, 'receiverAddress', amount)
```
