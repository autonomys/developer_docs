## Auto SDK

### What is the Auto SDK?

The **Auto SDK** is a powerful toolkit of JavaScript/TypeScript packages for developers to seamlessly integrate with the Autonomys Network. It provides simple APIs for interacting with the *consensus* layer, utilizing *data storage*, managing *decentralized identities*, and (soon) handling *AI3 payments*, in addition to general-purpose functions essential for building decentralized applications (dApps)—all in JavaScript and TypeScript—abstracting away the complexities of blockchain and smart contracts.

### Key features:

- **Modular Architecture**: Use only the packages you need.
- **Easy to Use**: Simplifies blockchain operations with high-level functions.
- **Flexible**: Suitable for both beginners and experienced blockchain developers.
- **Open-source**: Built by and for the community.

### Why the Auto SDK?

- **Simplify Development**: Focus on your application's logic rather than blockchain intricacies.
- **Accelerate Time-to-Market**: Reduce development time with ready-to-use functions.
- **Ensure Compatibility**: Stay up-to-date with the latest Autonomys blockchain protocols.
- **Enhance Security**: Utilize well-tested code for critical operations like identity management.

## Packages

The Auto SDK monorepo contains multiple packages, each serving a specific purpose. All packages are published to `npm` under the `@autonomys` scope:

- **`@autonomys/auto-utils`**: Core utility functions for interacting with the Autonomys Network.
- **`@autonomys/auto-consensus`**: Functions for interacting with the consensus layer.
- **`@autonomys/auto-drive`**: Tools for preparing, uploading and managing data for on-chain storage.

## Step-by-step guide

### Requirements

- **`Node.js`** (version 14 or higher)
- **`yarn`** or **`npm`**

### Installation

Install the packages you need via `npm` or `yarn`. For example, to install `@autonomys/auto-utils` and `@autonomys/auto-consensus`:

#### Using `npm`

```bash
npm install @autonomys/auto-utils @autonomys/auto-consensus
```

#### Using `yarn`

```bash
yarn add @autonomys/auto-utils @autonomys/auto-consensus
```

### Cloning the repository and building locally (*optional*)

If you want to run the SDK packages locally or contribute to the SDK, clone the repository and build the packages from source. Setup instructions:

#### 1. Clone the repository
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/autonomys/auto-sdk.git
   ```

#### 2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd auto-sdk
   ```

#### 3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

#### 4. Compile all packages
   ```bash
   yarn run build
   ```

#### 5. Run tests on all packages
   ```bash
   yarn run test
   ```

### Localhost testing (*optional*)

Test the SDK packages against a local Autonomys node:

#### 1. Verify OS and architecture settings

Edit the `scripts/download.sh` file and ensure that lines 3-7 match your current operating system and architecture:

```bash
# Change the following variables as needed
# OS to download
OS="macos" # Options: macos | ubuntu | windows
# Architecture to download
ARCHITECTURE="aarch64" # Options: aarch64 | x86_64-skylake | x86_64-v2
```

#### 2. Run the development script

Execute the following command to start the local node and farmer:

```bash
node scripts/run-dev.js
```

This script will:

1. Download the latest version of the node and farmer compatible with your OS and architecture (`scripts/download.sh`).
2. Start the node and create/insert the keystore (`scripts/run-node.sh`).
3. Start the farmer (`scripts/run-farmer.sh`).
4. Register the node as an operator, wait for synchronization, and then terminate the node and farmer (handled within `scripts/run-dev.js`).
5. Restart the node as an operator (`scripts/run-operator.sh`).
6. Restart the farmer (`scripts/run-farmer.sh`).

#### 3. Run tests on the local node

```bash
bash scripts/localhost-run-test.sh
```

The tests will automatically detect and execute on the local node and farmer.

## Next steps

With the Auto SDK set up locally, you're ready to start building and testing your blockchain applications. Explore the following pages for code examples and a functions overview.
