# Auto Drive Gateway

## What is Auto Drive Gateway?

Auto Gateway is a unified gateway solution designed for seamlessly accessing files or folders permanently stored on the Autonomys Mainnet & Taurus testnet through a single, streamlined interface. The gateway is available [here](https://gateway.autonomys.xyz/).

## How Gateways Work

In decentralized storage systems, files are identified by their Content Identifier (CID) rather than traditional file paths. A gateway acts as a bridge between the decentralized network and standard web protocols, allowing you to access stored content using familiar HTTP requests.

Think of it as a web interface that translates CIDs into downloadable files - similar to how IPFS gateways work, but specifically designed for the Autonomys network.

## When to Use Auto Drive Gateway

### Direct File Access
- **Public file sharing**: Share files with others who don't have the Auto Drive SDK
- **Web integration**: Embed files directly in websites using standard HTML tags
- **Browser downloads**: Allow users to download files directly through their browser
- **CDN-like functionality**: Serve static assets like images, documents, or media files

### Development & Testing
- **Quick verification**: Quickly check if your uploads were successful
- **Debugging**: Verify file integrity without writing code
- **Prototyping**: Access files during development without implementing full SDK integration

### Integration Scenarios
- **Third-party applications**: Enable other services to access your stored files
- **API responses**: Return direct download links in your API responses
- **Mobile apps**: Simple file access without complex SDK integration

## Gateway Endpoints

### Retrieve File by CID
```
GET /file/:cid
```
Retrieves a file based on its Content Identifier (CID).

**Responses:**
- `200 OK`: Successfully retrieves and serves the requested file
- `302 Redirect`: Redirects to `/folder/:cid` if the CID corresponds to a folder
- `404 Not Found`: If no file is found for the provided CID

### Retrieve Folder by CID
```
GET /folder/:cid
```
Retrieves a folder based on its Content Identifier (CID).

**Responses:**
- `200 OK`: Successfully retrieves and serves the requested folder
- `302 Redirect`: Redirects to `/file/:cid` if the CID corresponds to a file  
- `404 Not Found`: If no folder is found for the provided CID

## Usage Examples

### Direct Browser Access
```
https://gateway.autonomys.xyz/file/your-file-cid-here
```

### HTML Integration
```html
<!-- Display an image -->
<img src="https://gateway.autonomys.xyz/file/your-image-cid" alt="My Image">

<!-- Download link -->
<a href="https://gateway.autonomys.xyz/file/your-document-cid" download>Download Document</a>
```

### API Response
```javascript
const response = {
  filename: "document.pdf",
  downloadUrl: `https://gateway.autonomys.xyz/file/${fileCid}`,
  size: 1024000
}
```

## Finding Your CIDs

To use the gateway, you'll need the CID of your uploaded file or folder. You can find CIDs:

1. In your [Auto Drive Dashboard](https://ai3.storage/) after uploading files
2. From the return value of SDK upload functions
3. In your application logs where upload responses are recorded

Simply enter your CID in the gateway interface or construct the URL directly for programmatic access.
