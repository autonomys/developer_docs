# Creating Your Auto-Drive API Key

## Authentication Overview

All requests to the Auto-Drive APIs require authentication using an API key. The API key is a string that authenticates your requests to the Auto-Drive APIs.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Create an API Key

### 1. Access Auto-Drive Dashboard

1. Open [Auto Drive](https://ai3.storage/)
2. Sign in via Google, Discord, GitHub or Wallet

2. In the developers section, click on **'Create API Key'**
3. Read the modal message and click on generate

### 3. Alternative Method - Via Profile

You can also create an API key through your profile:

1. Click on `Profile` in the dashboard
2. Create your API key from the profile section

## Understanding Your Dashboard

Once logged in, your Dashboard will show:

- Your upload limit (currently **20MB** per month on mainnet and **100MB** per month on Taurus testnet)  
- Your download limit (currently **5GB** per month on both mainnet and Taurus testnet)  
- A list of **uploaded files** and their **CIDs**
- Options to **Download**, **Share** or **Remove** each file

> *Note:* Removing a file does not delete it from the DSN as it is permanent storage. It only removes the file from your Dashboard.

## Using Your API Key

Once you have your API key, you can use it to authenticate your requests:

```typescript
import { createAutoDriveApi } from '@autonomys/auto-drive'
import { NetworkId } from '@autonomys/auto-utils'

const api = createAutoDriveApi({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key-here',
  network: NetworkId.TAURUS // or NetworkId.MAINNET
})
```

## Network Selection

Auto Drive is available on both:
- **Mainnet** (`NetworkId.MAINNET`) - Production environment
- **Taurus Testnet** (`NetworkId.TAURUS`) - Testing environment

Choose the appropriate network based on your needs.

## Security Best Practices

- Keep your API key secure and never commit it to version control
- Use environment variables to store your API key
- Regenerate your API key if you suspect it has been compromised

## Next Steps

With your API key created, you can now:
- Install the Auto-Drive SDK
- Start uploading and downloading files
- Explore the full API reference
- Try the usage examples
