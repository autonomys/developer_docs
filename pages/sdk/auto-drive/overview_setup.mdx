# Auto-Drive Overview & Setup

## Introduction

The `@autonomys/auto-drive` package provides a set of tools to interact with the Autonomys Auto-Drive API.

## Features

- **Autonomys DSN**: Permanently store files on the Autonomys' DSN (Decentralized Store Network).
- **CID Management**: Just like with IPFS, each upload gets its own CID (Content Identifier). 
- **TypeScript Support**: Fully typed for an enhanced developer experience.

## Authentication

All requests to the Auto-Drive APIs require authentication using an API key. 

> **Need an API key?** See our [API Key Setup Guide](/sdk/auto-drive/create_api_key) for detailed instructions on creating your API key.

## Auto Drive Dashboard

The Auto Drive dashboard provides a web interface for managing your files and account:

- View your upload and download limits
- Browse and manage your uploaded files
- Share files with others
- Create and manage API keys

Access the dashboard at [Auto Drive](https://ai3.storage/) and sign in with Google, Discord, or GitHub.

### Sharing files

You can share files directly from the dashboard by clicking the `Share` button next to any file. You can share using a direct link or provide a user's public ID to share all their files.

## Installation

Install the package via `npm` or `yarn`:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @autonomys/auto-drive
npm install @autonomys/auto-utils

# Using yarn
yarn add @autonomys/auto-drive
yarn add @autonomys/auto-utils
```

## Importing

Import the `auto-drive` functions you need into your project:

```typescript
// Import specific functions
import { fs,createAutoDriveApi } from '@autonomys/auto-drive';
import { NetworkId } from '@autonomys/auto-utils'

// Or import everything
import * as drive from '@autonomys/auto-drive';
import { NetworkId } from '@autonomys/auto-utils'
```

## Network Configuration

As [Auto Drive](https://ai3.storage) is available on both Mainnet and the Taurus testnet, you need to configure the network when using the package:

```ts
import { NetworkId } from '@autonomys/auto-utils'

const api = createAutoDriveApi({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
  network: NetworkId.TAURUS | NetworkId.MAINNET
})
```
