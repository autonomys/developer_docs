## Sending NFTs

> *Note:* NFT minting and transfers are currently available exclusively on the **Taurus** testnet using the Autonomys NFT contract deployed at `0x505c243ec05dF81bC33295fF7C135D4D98063Da5`.

This guide walks you through sending NFTs on Autonomys using Remix, a Metamask-connected wallet, and the Eternal Mint platform.

---

### Why Use This Method?

Autonomys NFTs offer a significant advantage over traditional NFT infrastructure.

> **Unlike platforms that rely on IPFS**, Autonomys stores NFT metadata directly on **Autodrive**, our permanent decentralized storage layer.

- 🔒 Your NFT metadata is **never at risk of disappearing** due to expired IPFS pins.
- 🌐 Each NFT is linked to a **permanent Autodrive CID** that ensures long-term storage.
- 🚫 No third-party dependency for metadata — your NFT will never go offline.

### Quick Start Guide

This guide assumes you have experience with MetaMask and Remix. 

---

### Step 1: Mint Your NFT

1. Visit [Eternal Mint](https://eternalmint.xyz/).
2. Mint your NFT.
3. Once minted, **copy your NFT’s Token ID** — you’ll need it to send the NFT.

---

### Step 2: Load the Contract in Remix

1. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. Create a new Solidity file (e.g. `NFTTransfer.sol`), or use the deployed contract. Contract Address: 0x505c243ec05dF81bC33295fF7C135D4D98063Da5:

3. Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler tab.

### Step 3: Connect Remix to MetaMask

1. In Remix, navigate to the **Deploy & Run Transactions** panel.
2. Set the Environment to **Injected Provider - MetaMask**.
3. Connect your MetaMask wallet that’s configured to the **tAI3.0** testnet.

### Step 4: Deploy or Load the NFT Contract

- If deploying a new contract: Click **Deploy** and confirm in MetaMask.
- If using the existing NFT contract: Paste the deployed contract address into the `At Address` field and click **At Address**.

### Step 5: Use `safeTransferFrom` to Send Your NFT

Scroll down to the **Deployed Contracts** section and find the `safeTransferFrom` function. Fill in the following fields:

- `from`: Your wallet address (the current NFT holder)
- `to`: The recipient’s wallet address
- `id`: Token ID of the NFT you want to send
- `value`: Number of NFTs to send (usually `1`)
- `data`: Optional; use `0x` if not needed

Click **transact** and confirm the transaction in MetaMask.

### Verification

After the transaction is mined, the NFT will appear in the recipient’s wallet. You can verify the transfer using:

- Eternal Mint (search by Token ID)
- [Block explorer for the Autonomys testnet](https://blockscout.taurus.autonomys.xyz/)

---

### Troubleshooting

- **Gas issues?** Try increasing the gas limit manually in Remix.
- **Transaction fails?** Double-check your Token ID and that you’re connected to the correct network.
- **Contract not found?** Ensure you’ve loaded the contract at the correct address (`0x505c243ec05dF81bC33295fF7C135D4D98063Da5`).
