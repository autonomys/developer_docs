## Tracks

### Unstoppable AI Agents with [Autonomys Agents Framework](https://develop.autonomys.xyz/auto_agents_framework/introduction)
Create agents that can interact with social networks while maintaining permanent, verifiable memory on-chain through the Autonomys Network.

- Example: Cross-Platform Social Network Engagement Agent which stores all interactions permanently for transparency and verifiability.

### Build with [Auto Drive](https://develop.autonomys.xyz/application_examples/auto-drive) - Permanent Decentralized Storage
Revolutionize data permanence with Auto Drive! We're seeking innovative applications that leverage our next-generation distributed storage platform. Build solutions that ensure data is always accessible, immutable, and secure - without relying on traditional pinning services.

- Example: Decentralized Content Platforms, Data Archives, NFT Metadata Storage Solutions, Decentralized Social Media, etc.

### Secret AI dApps For dApps that utilize Secret Network's [Secret AI SDK](https://docs.scrt.network/secret-network-documentation/claive-ai/introduction)
Secret AI SDK is an advanced security layer that integrates seamlessly with Langchain's ChatOllama, ensuring a secure and efficient API interaction.

- Example: An AI agent that executes confidential trades.

### Cross-Chain dApps For dApps built on other blockchains that utilize Secret Network's [Confidential Computing Layer](https://scrt.network/confidential-computing-layer)
Cross-chain communication can be achieved via SecretPath, Axelar GMP, or IBC.

- Example: A dApp that stores encrypted data on Polygon or Solana and decrypts with Secret smart contracts (see developer resources below for examples).

### [Autonomys Network's Auto Drive](/application_examples/auto-drive) 
The next-generation distributed storage platform that ensures data is always accessible, immutable, and secure. Unlike traditional systems like IPFS, which rely on pinning or hosting services, Auto Drive guarantees permanent availability through a distributed network of incentivized storage nodes (farmers).

### [Autonomys Network's Auto Drive SDK](/sdk/auto-drive)
The Auto Drive SDK package provides utilities for creating and managing IPLD DAGs (InterPlanetary Linked Data Directed Acyclic Graphs) for files and folders, chunking large files, handling metadata, and creating folder structures suitable for distributed storage systems like IPFS on the Autonomys Network's DSN.
