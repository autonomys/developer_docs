## [Argu-mint]: On-Chain Memory Auto Agent

Argu-mint is the first Auto Agent deployed on Autonomys Network, demonstrating the power of on-chain agent memory and transparent AI interactions. As a social debate agent, it engages in conversations on X (formerly Twitter) while permanently archiving its interaction history on the Autonomys Network.

### How It Works

1. **Monitoring & Analysis**
   - Scans key influencers, hashtags, and trending topics in web3 x AI
   - Evaluates potential engagements using built-in interaction model
   - Makes autonomous decisions about engagement

2. **Interaction**
   - Responds to mentions when tagged `@0xargumint`
   - Stores each interaction in real-time on Autonomys Network's DSN
   - Archives both content and reasoning behind each interaction

3. **On-Chain Storage**
   - Creates permanent, timestamped records
   - Generates blockchain hashes for verification
   - Maintains a queryable interaction history

### See It in Action

- **Try the Agent**: Mention [@0xargumint](https://x.com/0xargumint) on X
- **Explore Memory**: Visit [0xargumint.ai](http://0xargumint.ai) to:
  - Search conversation archives
  - View interaction history
  - Explore decision reasoning
  - Verify on-chain storage

### Technical Implementation

Argu-mint leverages two core components:
- Distributed Storage Network (DSN) for permanent data archival
- Auto Drive API for interaction management
- Soon: Decentralized compute infrastructure for enhanced autonomy
