## [Auto Drive](https://ai3.storage/): Permanent distributed data storage

### What is Auto Drive?
[Auto Drive](https://ai3.storage/) is a **next-generation distributed storage platform** that ensures data is always accessible, immutable, and secure. Unlike traditional systems like IPFS, which rely on pinning or hosting services, Auto Drive guarantees **permanent availability** through a distributed network of incentivized storage nodes (farmers).

Whether you’re building a super dApp or Auto Agent, archiving important data, or hosting files for the web3 world, Auto Drive offers a seamless, developer-friendly solution.

### Key features

**1. Always-On Availability**: Ensures your files are always online (unlike IPFS, which requires pinning to maintain availability), making it ideal for applications that demand reliability.

**2. True Data Permanence**: Offers a permanent, tamper-proof solution for storing important data, removing any uncertainty about data loss, making it perfect for long-term archival.

**3. Built for Developers**: Simplifies complex decentralized storage operations with easy-to-use tools and APIs, allowing for easy integration, whether you’re a seasoned developer or a first-time builder.

**4. Sustainable and Scalable**: Decentralized, open-source, and community-driven. Incentivizes high-performing storage nodes, ensuring scalability and sustainability for years to come.

### Why Auto Drive?
**Auto Drive** bridges the gap between IPFS and truly permanent storage. IPFS can be problematic as files are removed if they aren’t pinned or hosted. Auto Drive solves this by guaranteeing data availability using advanced blockchain-backed storage proofs and redundancy that make data tamper-proof and permanently accessible without relying on pinning services.

### Use cases
- Host decentralized applications.
- Transparently store on-chain agent data.
- Permanently archive important files.

**Auto Drive** is the future of distributed storage. Whether you’re safeguarding critical data or building the next web3 innovation, Auto Drive is here to make it easier, faster and more secure.
