description: Getting Started with Autonomys Agents Framework via CLI
---

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   - Windows users will need to install Visual Studio C++ Redistributable. They can be found here: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe

2. Create a character configuration:

   ```bash
   yarn create-character your_character_name
   ```

   This will create a new character with the necessary configuration files based on the example template.

3. Configure your character:

   - Edit `characters/your_character_name/config/.env` with your API keys and credentials
   - Customize `characters/your_character_name/config/config.yaml` for agent behavior
   - Define personality in `characters/your_character_name/config/your_character_name.yaml`

4. Generate SSL certificates (required for API server):

   ```bash
   yarn generate-certs
   ```

5. Run the agent:

   ```bash
      cd <to/agent/project>
      yarn start <your_character_name>
   ```

   If you have stored workspace files (`characters`, `certs`, and `.cookies` directories) in a custom location, use the `--workspace` argument with the absolute path to your desired directory:

   ```bash
   # Specify a workspace path
   yarn start your_character_name --workspace=/path/to/workspace

   # Run in headless mode (no API server)
   yarn start your_character_name --headless
   ```

## Running Multiple Characters

You can run multiple characters simultaneously, each with their own configuration and personality:

1. Create multiple character configurations:

   ```bash
   yarn create-character alice
   yarn create-character bob
   ```

2. Configure each character separately with different personalities and API settings.

3. Run each character in a separate terminal session:

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   yarn start alice

   # Terminal 2
   yarn start bob
   ```

4. Each character will:
   - Have its own isolated memory and experience
   - Run its own API server on the specified port
   - Execute tasks according to its unique schedule and personality

## Docker Deployment

You can also run your agents using Docker. This provides isolation and makes it easy to run multiple agents simultaneously.

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system ([Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- Docker Compose Plugin required ([Compose Plugin Installation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/))
- Character configuration set up (follow steps from the Getting Started section)

### Running with Docker

1. **Generate your character's docker-compose file**

First make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x ./generate-compose.sh
```

Then generate the compose file:
```bash
./generate-compose.sh <your-character-name> [HOST_PORT] [API_PORT]
```

Examples:
```bash
# Run Alice on port 3011 with API port on 3011
./generate-compose.sh Alice 3011 3011

# Run Bob on port 3012 with API port on 3011
./generate-compose.sh Bob 3012 3011
```

2. **Manage the Docker container**

Build and start the container:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-{character-name}.yml up -d
```

Stop and remove the container:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-{character-name}.yml down
```

View container logs:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-{character-name}.yml logs -f
```

Access container shell:
```bash
docker exec -it autonomys-agent-{character-name} bash
```
