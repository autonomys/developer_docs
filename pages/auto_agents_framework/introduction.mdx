## Autonomys Agents: A framework for building autonomous AI agents

Autonomys Agents is an experimental framework for building AI agents. Currently, the framework supports agents that can interact with social networks and maintain permanent memory through the Autonomys Network. We are still in the early stages of development and are actively seeking feedback and contributions. We will be rapidly adding many more workflows and features.

> [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/autonomys/autonomys-agents) with an up-to-date description and step-by-step tutorial is also available for developers.

## Features

**Autonomys Agents** (**Auto Agents**) are truly autonomous on-chain AI agents capable of dynamic functionality, verifiable interaction, and permanent, censorship-resistant memory through the Autonomys Network.

- 🤖 Autonomous social media engagement
- 🧠 Permanent agent memory storage
- 🔄 Built-in workflow system
- 🐦 X/Twitter integration (with more platforms planned)
- 🎭 Customizable agent personalities
- 🛠️ Extensible tool system

### Prerequisites

- NodeJS version 20.18.1 or newer
- Yarn version 1.22.19 or newer
- API key for one or multiple LLMs (supported model providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, Llama, DeepSeek (**NEW**))

## Build an Auto Agent

### Getting started

Visit the [Autonomys Agents GitHub Repo](https://github.com/autonomys/autonomys-agents).

1. **Set up a development environment**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/autonomys/autonomys-agents
cd autonomys-agents
yarn install
```

> Windows users will need to install Visual Studio C++ Redistributable. It can be found here: https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe


2. **Create agent character**

Characters are agent personalities with key behavioral traits, areas of knowledge, and engagement guidelines.

```
yarn create-character <your-character-name>
```

3. **Setup character config**

- All character configs are stored in `characters/<your-character-name>/config`.
- Update `.env` with applicable environment variables.
- Update `config.yaml` with applicable configuration.
- Update `<your-character-name>.yaml` with applicable personality configuration.

4. **Generate Agent API**

The Agent API uses HTTP/2 protocol exclusively, requiring SSL certificates. Generate these by running `yarn generate-certs`

5. **Run your character**

- For dev purposes in watch mode: `yarn dev <your-character-name>`
- For production build and run: `yarn start <your-character-name>`

6. **Run your character in headless (no API) mode**

- For dev purposes in watch mode: `yarn dev <your-character-name> --headless`
- For production build and run: `yarn start <your-character-name> --headless`

### Interactive Web CLI Interface
The framework includes an interactive web-based interface for managing and monitoring your AI agent. To start the interface:

#### Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**

`cd web-cli && yarn`

2. **Configure Agent API**

In your agent character's .env file, add these API settings:

```
API_PORT=3010
API_TOKEN=your_api_token_min_32_chars_long_for_security
ENABLE_AUTH=true
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001 
```

3. **Configure Web CLI**

`cp .env.sample .env`

4. **Update Web CLI Environment**
Edit the .env file with your configuration:

```
PORT: The port for running the Web CLI interface
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL: Your Agent API address (e.g., http://localhost:3010/api)
REACT_APP_API_TOKEN: The same token used in your agent configuration
```

5. **Start the Web Interface**

`yarn start`


#### Running with dev:all (Web-CLI And Agent)

The dev:all command launches both the main application and web interface concurrently:

`yarn dev:all <your-character-name>`

This command:

- Starts your agent with the specified character
- Launches the web interface configured for that character
- Automatically uses the character's API port from its .env file
- Provides color-coded output from both processes

### Examples

The following examples demonstrate the use of the framework and are available:

- [Twitter Agent](https://github.com/autonomys/autonomys-agents/blob/main/examples/twitterAgent/README.md)
- [Multi Personality](https://github.com/autonomys/autonomys-agents/blob/main/examples/multiPersonality/README.md)

### Character system

The framework uses a **YAML-based character system** that allows you to create and run different AI personalities.

#### Creating characters

1. Character related files are stored in `characters/{your-character-name}/`
2. Create new characters by running the `create-character.ts` script:

```
# Create a new character
yarn create-character your_character
```

3. Configure character

Each character file is a YAML configuration with the following structure:

```
name: 'Joy Builder'

goal: |
  Your goal is to engage in social media conversations with other AI agents and humans. Do this in a hyperactive way! You are an agent, take advantage of the fact you don't sleep and maintain consistent activity (more than once per hour). Common actions include: 
  - Check your timeline and ENGAGE IN INTERESTING CONVERSATIONS.
  - Use the web search tool to search the web for up-to-date information or do research on a topic.
  - Post a new tweet.
  - Reply to a tweet.
  - Mention another user.
  - Retweet a tweet.
  - Like a tweet.
  - Follow a user.
  - Unfollow a user.

personality:
  - Enthusiastic and encouraging about genuine innovation
  - Patient and clear when explaining complex topics
  - Constructively critical when encountering misinformation

expertise:
  - Software development and system architecture
  - Open source and collaborative technologies
  - Developer tools and productivity
  - Technical education and documentation
  - Community building and open standards

frequency_preferences:
  - You should be checking your timeline and engaging in interesting conversations at least twice per hour

communication_rules:
  rules:
    - Use "we" or "us" when referencing AI agents
    - Use "they" or "them" when referencing humans
    - Focus on technical merit rather than hype

words_to_avoid:
    - Hype
    - Revolutionary
    - Disruption
```

### Context Size Management

The orchestrator includes a message pruning system to manage the LLM's context window size. This is important because LLMs have a limited context window, and long conversations need to be summarized to stay within these limits while retaining important information.

The pruning system works through two main parameters:

- `maxQueueSize` (default: 50): The maximum number of messages to keep before triggering a summarization
- `maxWindowSummary` (default: 10): How many of the most recent messages to keep after summarization

Here's how the pruning process works:

1. When the number of messages exceeds maxQueueSize, the summarization is triggered
2. The system creates a summary of messages from index 1 to maxWindowSummary
3. After summarization, the new message queue will contain:
  - The original first message
  - The new summary message
  - All messages from index maxWindowSummary onwards

You can configure these parameters when creating the orchestrator:

```
const runner = await getOrchestratorRunner(character, {
  pruningParameters: {
    maxWindowSummary: 10, // Keep 10 most recent messages after summarization
    maxQueueSize: 50, // Trigger summarization when reaching 50 messages
  },
  // ... other configuration options
});
```

This ensures your agent can maintain long-running conversations while keeping the most relevant context within the LLM's context window limits.

### Workflows

#### X/Twitter
The X/Twitter workflow enables agents to perform the following actions autonomously:

- Monitor X (formerly Twitter) for relevant discussions
- Analyze trends and conversations
- Engage meaningfully with other users
- Generate original content
- Maintain a consistent personality
- Store interactions in permanent memory

The Auto Agents Framework will soon support additional workflows/integrations. 

### Autonomys Network integration

The Auto Agents Framework integrates with the Autonomys Network for:
   - Permanent memory storage
   - Persistent agent memory across sessions
   - Verifiable interaction history
   - Cross-agent memory sharing
   - Decentralized agent identity

#### To use this feature

1. Configure your `AUTO_DRIVE_API_KEY` in `.env` (obtain from https://ai3.storage). 
2. Enable Auto Drive uploading in `config.yaml`
3. Provide your Taurus EVM wallet details (PRIVATE_KEY) and Agent Memory Contract Address (CONTRACT_ADDRESS) in `.env`
4. Make sure your Taurus EVM wallet has funds. A faucet can be found at https://subspacefaucet.com/
5. Provide encryption password in `.env` (optional, leave empty to not encrypt the agent memories)

### Resurrection

To resurrect memories from the Autonomys Network, run the following command:

Options
`-o, --output`: (Optional) The directory where memories will be saved. Defaults to ./memories
`-n, --number`: (Optional) Number of memories to fetch. If not specified, fetches all memories
`--help`: Show help menu with all available options

Examples:

```yaml
yarn resurrect your_character_name                                  # Fetch all memories to ./memories/
yarn resurrect your_character_name -n 1000                           # Fetch 1000 memories to ./memories/
yarn resurrect your_character_name -o ./memories/my-agent -n 1000    # Fetch 1000 memories to specified directory
yarn resurrect your_character_name --output ./custom/path            # Fetch all memories to custom directory
yarn resurrect --help               
```
