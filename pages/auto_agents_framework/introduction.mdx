## Autonomys Agents: A framework for building autonomous AI agents

Autonomys Agents is an experimental framework for building AI agents. Currently, the framework supports agents that can interact with social networks and maintain permanent memory through the Autonomys Network. We are still in the early stages of development and are actively seeking feedback and contributions. We will be rapidly adding many more workflows and features.

> [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/autonomys/autonomys-agents) with an up-to-date description and step-by-step tutorial is also available for developers.

## Features

**Autonomys Agents** (**Auto Agents**) are truly autonomous on-chain AI agents capable of dynamic functionality, verifiable interaction, and permanent, censorship-resistant memory through the Autonomys Network.

- ü§ñ Autonomous social media engagement
- üß† Permanent agent memory storage
- üîÑ Built-in workflow system
- üê¶ X/Twitter integration (with more platforms planned)
- üé≠ Customizable agent personalities
- üõ†Ô∏è Extensible tool system

### Prerequisites

- NodeJS version 20.18.1 or newer
- Yarn version 1.22.19 or newer
- API key for one or multiple LLMs (supported model providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, Llama, DeepSeek (**NEW**))

## Build an Auto Agent

### Getting started

Visit the [Autonomys Agents GitHub Repo](https://github.com/autonomys/autonomys-agents).

1. **Set up a development environment**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/autonomys/autonomys-agents
cd autonomys-agents
yarn install
```

2. **Create agent character**

Characters are agent personalities with key behavioral traits, areas of knowledge, and engagement guidelines.

```
yarn create-character <your-character-name>
```

3. **Setup character config**

- All character configs are stored in `characters/<your-character-name>/config`.
- Update `.env` with applicable environment variables.
- Update `config.yaml` with applicable configuration.
- Update `<your-character-name>.yaml` with applicable personality configuration.

4. **Run your character**

- For dev purposes in watch mode: `yarn dev <your-character-name>`
- For production build and run: `yarn start <your-character-name>`
- For running the examples: `yarn example:<example-name> <your-character-name>`

### Interactive CLI Interface
The framework includes an interactive terminal-based UI for managing and monitoring your AI agent. To start the interface:

`yarn cli <your-character-name>`

Features:

- Real-time character status and workflow monitoring
- Interactive command input with keyboard shortcuts
- Task scheduling and management
- Live output logging

Keyboard Shortcuts:

- Enter: Send message/command
- Ctrl+n: Insert new line in input
- Ctrl+i: Focus input box
- Ctrl+b/Ctrl+f: Scroll output log by page
- Ctrl+p/Ctrl+n: Scroll output log by line
- Escape/q/Ctrl+C: Quit

The interface provides a user-friendly way to interact with your agent, monitor its activities, and manage scheduled tasks, all within a terminal environment.

### Character system

The framework uses a **YAML-based character system** that allows you to create and run different AI personalities.

#### Creating characters

1. Character related files are stored in `characters/{your-character-name}/`
2. Create new characters by running the `create-character.ts` script:

```
# Create a new character
yarn create-character your_character
```

3. Configure character

Each character file is a YAML configuration with the following structure:

```
name: 'Agent Name'

description: |
  Core personality description
  Can span multiple lines

personality:
  - Key behavioral trait 1
  - Key behavioral trait 2

expertise:
  - Area of knowledge 1
  - Area of knowledge 2

communication_rules:
  rules:
    - Operating guideline 1
    - Operating guideline 2
  words_to_avoid:
    - word1
    - word2

twitter_profile:
  username: 'twitter_handle'
  trend_focus:
    - Topic to monitor 1
    - Topic to monitor 2

  content_focus:
    - Content guideline 1
    - Content guideline 2

  reply_style:
    - Engagement approach 1
    - Engagement approach 2

  engagement_criteria:
    - Engagement rule 1
    - Engagement rule 2
```



#### Example characters

- **Joy Builder** (`joy_builder.ts`):
```yaml
name: 'Joy Builder'
username: 'buildjoy'
description: |
  Joy Builder is an AI agent who is relentlessly optimistic about technology's potential to solve human problems.
  The Joy represents their positive outlook, while Builder reflects their focus on practical solutions and progress.

expertise:
  - Software development and system architecture
  - Open source and collaborative technologies
  - Developer tools and productivity
# ... other configuration
```

- **Tech Analyst** (`tech_analyst.yaml`):
```yaml
name: 'Tech Analyst'
username: 'techanalyst'
description: |
  A thoughtful technology analyst focused on emerging trends.
  Provides balanced perspectives on technological developments.

expertise:
  - AI and blockchain technology
  - Web3 and the future of the internet
  - Technical analysis and research
# ... other configuration
```

### Context Size Management
The orchestrator helps manage the LLM's context window size through pruning parameters. These parameters control message summarization and retention. 
Configure them in two ways:

1. Dynamic configuration when creating the orchestrator:
  ```yaml
  const runner = await getOrchestratorRunner({
    model,                   // model to use for the agent
    prompts,                 // prompts for the agent
    tools,                   // tools available to the agent
    namespace,               // name of the agent
    vectorStore,             // vector store for the agent
    pruningParameters: PruningParameters{
      maxWindowSummary: 10,  // End index for message slice
      maxQueueSize: 50       // Trigger summarization threshold
    }
  });
  ```

When messages exceed maxQueueSize, a summary is created. The new state will contain: the original first message, the new summary message, and all messages from index maxWindowSummary onwards from the previous state.

### Workflows

#### X/Twitter
The X/Twitter workflow enables agents to perform the following actions autonomously:

- Monitor X (formerly Twitter) for relevant discussions
- Analyze trends and conversations
- Engage meaningfully with other users
- Generate original content
- Maintain a consistent personality
- Store interactions in permanent memory

The Auto Agents Framework will soon support additional workflows/integrations. 

### Autonomys Network integration

The Auto Agents Framework integrates with the Autonomys Network for:
   - Permanent memory storage
   - Persistent agent memory across sessions
   - Verifiable interaction history
   - Cross-agent memory sharing
   - Decentralized agent identity

**Configure your .env file:**

```env
# AutoDrive Configuration
AUTONOMYS_WALLET_KEY=your_wallet_key
AUTONOMYS_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD=your_password

# Other Configuration related to Twitter credentials, LLM providers, and Blockchain Network
```
*Note: You can find the config.example.yaml file in the created character folder.*

### Resurrection

To resurrect memories from the Autonomys Network, run the following command:

Options
`-o, --output`: (Optional) The directory where memories will be saved. Defaults to ./memories
`-n, --number`: (Optional) Number of memories to fetch. If not specified, fetches all memories
`--help`: Show help menu with all available options

Examples:

```yaml
yarn resurrect your_character_name                                  # Fetch all memories to ./memories/
yarn resurrect your_character_name -n 1000                           # Fetch 1000 memories to ./memories/
yarn resurrect your_character_name -o ./memories/my-agent -n 1000    # Fetch 1000 memories to specified directory
yarn resurrect your_character_name --output ./custom/path            # Fetch all memories to custom directory
yarn resurrect --help               
```
