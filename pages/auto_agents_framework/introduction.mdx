## Autonomys Agents: A framework for building autonomous AI agents

<Callout type="info">
The **Auto Agents Framework** is experimental and still in the early stages of development. It currently primarily supports agentic social network interaction. We are actively seeking feedback and contributions, and will be rapidly adding many more workflows and features.

## Features

**Autonomys Agents** (**Auto Agents**) are truly autonomous on-chain AI agents capable of dynamic functionality, verifiable interaction, and permanent, censorship-resistant memory through the Autonomys Network.

- ü§ñ Autonomous social media engagement
- üß† Permanent agent memory storage
- üîÑ Built-in workflow system
- üê¶ X/Twitter integration (with more platforms planned)
- üé≠ Customizable agent personalities
- üõ†Ô∏è Extensible tool system

### Prerequisites

- NodeJS version 20.18.1 or newer
- Yarn version 1.22.19 or newer
- API key for one or multiple LLMs (supported model providers: Anthropic, OpenAI, Llama, DeepSeek (**NEW**)

## Build an Auto Agent

### Getting started

1. **Set up a development environment**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/autonomys/autonomys-agents
cd autonomys-agents
yarn install
```

2. **Create agent character**

Characters are agent personalities with key behavioral traits, areas of knowledge, and engagement guidelines.

```
yarn create-character <your-character-name>
```

3. **Setup character config**

- All character configs are stored in `characters/<your-character-name>/config`.
- Update `.env` with applicable environment variables.
- Update `config.yaml` with applicable configuration.
- Update `<your-character-name>.yaml` with applicable personality configuration.

4. **Run your character**

- For dev purposes in watch mode: `yarn dev <your-character-name>`
- For production build and run: `yarn start <your-character-name>`

### Character system

The framework uses a **YAML-based character system** that allows you to create and run different AI personalities.

#### Creating characters

1. Character related files are stored in `characters/{your-character-name}/`
2. Create new characters by running the `create-character.ts` script:

```
# Create a new character
yarn create-character your_character
```

3. Configure character

Each character file is a YAML configuration with the following structure:

```
name: 'Agent Name'

description: |
  Core personality description
  Can span multiple lines

personality:
  - Key behavioral trait 1
  - Key behavioral trait 2

expertise:
  - Area of knowledge 1
  - Area of knowledge 2

communication_rules:
  rules:
    - Operating guideline 1
    - Operating guideline 2
  words_to_avoid:
    - word1
    - word2

twitter_profile:
  username: 'twitter_handle'
  trend_focus:
    - Topic to monitor 1
    - Topic to monitor 2

  content_focus:
    - Content guideline 1
    - Content guideline 2

  reply_style:
    - Engagement approach 1
    - Engagement approach 2

  engagement_criteria:
    - Engagement rule 1
    - Engagement rule 2
```



#### Example characters

- **Joy Builder** (`joy_builder.ts`):
```yaml
name: 'Joy Builder'
username: 'buildjoy'
description: |
  Joy Builder is an AI agent who is relentlessly optimistic about technology's potential to solve human problems.
  The Joy represents their positive outlook, while Builder reflects their focus on practical solutions and progress.

expertise:
  - Software development and system architecture
  - Open source and collaborative technologies
  - Developer tools and productivity
# ... other configuration
```

- **Tech Analyst** (`tech_analyst.yaml`):
```yaml
name: 'Tech Analyst'
username: 'techanalyst'
description: |
  A thoughtful technology analyst focused on emerging trends.
  Provides balanced perspectives on technological developments.

expertise:
  - AI and blockchain technology
  - Web3 and the future of the internet
  - Technical analysis and research
# ... other configuration
```

### Workflows

#### X/Twitter
The X/Twitter workflow enables agents to:

- Monitor X (formerly Twitter) for relevant discussions
- Analyze trends and conversations
- Engage meaningfully with other users
- Generate original content
- Maintain a consistent personality
- Store interactions in permanent memory

The Auto Agents Framework will soon support additional workflows/integrations. 

### Autonomys Network integration

The Auto Agents Framework integrates with the Autonomys Network for:
   - Permanent memory storage
   - Persistent agent memory across sessions
   - Verifiable interaction history
   - Cross-agent memory sharing
   - Decentralized agent identity

**Configure your .env file:**

```env
AUTO_DRIVE_UPLOAD=true
AUTONOMYS_WALLET_KEY=your_wallet_key
AUTONOMYS_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD=your_password
```
